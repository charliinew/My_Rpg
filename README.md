# My Rpg ðŸŽ¯

My RPG is a project at Epitech where the aim is to create a complete role-playing game (RPG) in C using CSFML.

## Bytes and Sword ðŸ‘‘

You play the role of a recruit who has lost everything after being unjustly banished from his castle. Stripped of his happiness, his home and his position, he finds himself on an empty plain with a house you can see in the distance.
As he navigates this new reality, he must help the villagers while facing the dangers that lurk in the shadows. As he helps the villagers and battles menacing goblins, he begins to uncover secrets that could allow him to return to the castle, where his ultimate destiny and potential for redemption await.

### In-game Tutorial

A tutorial is available in the game to guide players through the basic mechanics and controls. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to learn how to navigate the world, interact with characters, and engage in combat.

- **New Game**: Start a new game and begin your adventure.
